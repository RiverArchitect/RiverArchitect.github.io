The code was developed based on data from California's Yuba River and example results can be downloaded.

Read the [Get Started][7] Wiki  to learn about the terminology used in *River Architect* and create river [*Conditions*](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/Signposts#new-condition). 

*River Architect* comes with the following modules: 
 - Lifespan mapping: 
	+ [Lifespan and Design](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/LifespanDesign) map creation
	+ [Best Lifespan](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/MaxLifespan) identification
 - Morphology and Terraforming: 
	+ [Modify Terrain](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/ModifyTerrain) with thresholds or [RiverBuilder](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/model-codes/river-builder)
	+ [Volume Assessment](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/VolumeAssessment) of terraforming (earthworks)
 - Ecohydraulics: 
	+ [Seasonal Habitat Area Calcluator](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/SHArC) (SHArC)
	+ [Stranding Risk](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/StrandingRisk) Analyses
 - [Project Maker](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/ProjectMaker) for cost-benefit analysis.

An earlier Python2-version of *River Architect* [can be downloaded here][8](usage deprecated).

Future developments will focus on improving the GUIs, developing active terraforming modules and re-writing geospatial analyses with the [`gdal` package](https://gdal.org/) to resolve license issues with `arcpy`.
