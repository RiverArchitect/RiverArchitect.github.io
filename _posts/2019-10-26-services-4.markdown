The code was developed based on data from California's Yuba River and example results can be downloaded.

Read the Wiki's [Signposts][7] to learn about the terminology used in *River Architect* and create river [*Conditions*](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/Signposts#new-condition) with the [GetStarted](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/Signposts#getstarted) module to start analyses. 

*River Architect* comes with the following modules: 
 - Lifespan mapping: 
   	+ [Lifespan and Design](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/LifespanDesign) map creation
      	+ [Best Lifespan](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/MaxLifespan) identification
 - Morphology and Terraforming: 
   	+ [Modify Terrain](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/ModifyTerrain) with thresholds or [RiverBuilder](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/model-codes/river-builder)
      	+ [Volume Assessment](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/VolumeAssessment) of terraforming (earthworks)
 - Ecohydraulics: 
   	+ [Seasonal Habitat Area Calcluator](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/SHArC) (SHArC)
      	+ Habitat [Connectivity](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/Connectivity) Analyses
 - [Project Maker](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/ProjectMaker) for cost-benefit analysis.

Please note that *River Architect* has undergone important changes since the release of the  last stable Python2 version ([download last stable Python2-River-Architect][8]).

Future developments will focus on improving the GUIs, developing the ModifyTerrain module for automating terraforming planning, and migrating to QGIS's Python core.
